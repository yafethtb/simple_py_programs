# ABOUT THE PROGRAM

This poject is inspred to the day-15 challenge of "100 Days of Code Python Bootcamp" course by Angela Yu in Udemy. Her approach is by making the data structur inside the main file and then using them in a program taht looping until the resources depleted or user input 'off' to kill the program.
## My approach
My first approach isn't good, so I learn how angela made the program and combine her ideas to my program.

I want the user to have ability to undertand what is and what happen if they use the program. That's why I'm using list of menu they can choose by only pressing the number of the menu. I'm also using many user input to make user have feeling they can control the machine. While in the same time I can control user behaviour a little bit to make them only choose what I offer.

My code is surely longer than what Angela has made. But knowing that people understand and won't be confused while using the program is what important for me.
